No-one knows what they are doing.\r\n\r\n#### The Rules\r\n\r\nA code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk gamer. This is true both in person and online.\r\n\r\n- We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them \"ironically\".\r\n- Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.\r\n- Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it's a tournament).\r\n- We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.\r\n- We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make computer more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this \"has gone too far\" aren’t.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
