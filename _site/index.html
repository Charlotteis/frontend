      <p>Gamer Anonymous is a co-operative of gamers who want to create a nicer, more inclusive gaming environment to play in.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>We aim to create an online gaming environment based on inclusivity, diversity and safety.</p>

<p>We want to enable more people from under represented or diverse groups to enjoy activities in gaming:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Casting games</li>
  <li>Playing in esports tournements</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impostors-welcome">Impostors Welcome</h2>

<p>If you’re from a background which isn’t well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want to make a difference.</p>

<p>If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want your help making a difference.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about not being gamer enough, come.</p>

<p>If you think you’re an imposter, come.</p>

<p>This isn’t a group of experts, just people.</p>

<p>We are interested in the social and gaming problems.</p>

<p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>

<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>

<p>A code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk gamer. This is true both in person and online.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them “ironically”.</li>
  <li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
  <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it’s a tournament).</li>
  <li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
  <li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make computer more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this “has gone too far” aren’t.</li>
</ul>
