<p>If you’re from a background which isn’t well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want to make a difference.</p>

<p>If you’re from a background which is well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want your help making a difference.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about not being gamer enough, come.</p>

<p>If you think you’re an imposter, come.</p>

<p>If your day job isn’t game, come.</p>

<p>This isn’t a group of experts, just people.</p>

<p>We are interested in the social and gaming problems.</p>

<p>This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.</p>

<a name="the-rules" class="anchor" href="#the-rules"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Rules</h4>

<p>A code of conduct applies wherever we gather to talk gamer. This is true both in person and online.</p>

<ul>
<li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".</li>
<li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
<li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it's a tournament).</li>
<li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
<li>We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make computer more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren’t.</li>
</ul>
