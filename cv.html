<h3 id='money_advice_service'>Money Advice Service</h3>

<p><em>Ruby Developer, June 2013 &#8211; Present</em></p>

<h3 id='ricardoaea'>Ricardo-AEA</h3>

<p><em>Lead Drupal Developer, October 2012 &#8211; Janurary 2013</em></p>

<p>Worked with the project manager to provide technical analysis on a number of upcoming projects. As lead Drupal developer, I provided technical specifications to non-drupal developers. Moreover, I developed a site for the Environment Agency that allows them to produce &#8216;quality protocol compliance assessment forms&#8217; to deliver compliance reports to end users.</p>

<h3 id='comic_relief'>Comic Relief</h3>

<p><em>PHP Developer, June 2012 &#8211; September 2012</em></p>

<p>As part of the special projects team, I developed a back end system to process users&#8217; donations and marketing preferences submitted on Comic Relief&#8217;s websites. I also implemented a behavior driven development (BDD) and testing suite, allowing the team to develop and test using user stories. Moreover, I advised the quality team, project manager and product owner on how to leverage the BDD methodology to produce higher quality user stories.</p>

<h3 id='dachis_group'>Dachis Group</h3>

<p><em>PHP Developer, September 2011 &#8211; May 2012</em></p>

<p>Working with an exceptional team, I delivered two social business websites using Drupal 6, one for Red Bull and another for the African Forum for Agricultural Advisory Services (AFAS). On AFAS I was also the lead developer, scrum master and managed all business analysis, user stories and the product backlog.</p>

<p>I organised internal &#8216;presentation by example&#8217; and &#8216;knowledge sharing&#8217; events, and conducted research, business analysis and wrote a proposal for hosting community tech clinic sessions.</p>

<h3 id='catch_digital'>Catch Digital</h3>

<p><em>PHP Developer, June 2011 &#8211; September 2011</em></p>

<p>For the charity, Scope, I helped develop a social drawing and story sharing website. Furthermore, I developed the system that allowed users to log in to either of Scope&#8217;s websites with the same username and password, keeping all of their data synchronised. I also developed the moderation portal, so that site moderators could ensure content was suitable for Scope&#8217;s audience.</p>

<p>Additionally, I trained the other developers in using Drupal&#8217;s collaborative development features which helped Catch with their larger, multi-developer projects.</p>

<h3 id='the_internet_team_ltd'>The Internet Team Ltd</h3>

<p><em>Business Owner, 2008 &#8211; 2010</em></p>

<p>For 2 years I ran a technical consultancy. Running my own business meant that I had to handle the full life cycle of a project, from business analysis and conception through to development and support. During this time I delivered an e-commerce site for AfterHours that integrated with their stock control systems. I also prototyped a system that imported their suppliers&#8217; stock feeds, allowing the purchasing team to quickly find which supplier was selling items at the lowest price.</p>

<p>I provided systems administration services to a number of companies including Radar Music Videos and markanddan.com. My greatest achievement in this area was when I set-up and supported the servers that hosted a live chat with J.K. Rowling for the launch of one of her Harry Potter books, which had 70,000 visitors during the one-hour chat.</p>

<p>For Orange Frog Design, I provided technical consultation and developed a number of websites, including an e-commerce site for a children&#8217;s clothing company and a membership site for Clowns International. In addition, I produced the code (and sometimes the designs) for a number of email marketing campaigns for Orange Frog&#8217;s clients and provided the technology to manage lists, send the campaigns and view stats.</p>

<h3 id='bmb_ltd'>BMB Ltd</h3>

<p><em>PHP Developer &amp; Systems Administrator, November 2006 &#8211; May 2008</em></p>

<p>My role at BMB was threefold. As a PHP developer, I worked on a number of data gathering and marketing websites. I also wrote an events management system used by General Motors for a number of their b2b events.</p>

<p>In addition to this, I also performed as a development process leader. This involved selecting and deploying an issue tracking system, standardising deployment processes and introducing source code version control across the team. This greatly reduced errors, streamlined workflow and helped improve the working environment, helping the team create better products.</p>

<p>Finally, I was responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and selling a new high-availability hosting offering, which I successfully sold to their clients: General Motors, Big Yellow Storage and Toucansurf. The approach that the company used, that I championed, represented a significant organisational change for BMB.</p></div></section><footer><div class="inner"><p>&copy; Rachel Graves</p></div></footer></body></html>
