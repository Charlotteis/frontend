Gamer Anonymous is a co-operative of people who want to create a nicer, more inclusive gaming community.

Gamer Anonymous is not a clan, tribe or clique.

## The Plan

We want to provide a community 'clan' type environment including Forums, IRC chatrooms, TeamSpeak servers, Casting, e-sports tournaments and more.

We want to enable more people from under represented or diverse groups to enjoy activities in gaming:

- Casting games.
- Playing in esports tournaments.

We want to educate by hosting public discussions on inclusivity and diversity, and leading by example.


## Impostors Welcome

- If you're from a background which is well-represented in most gaming groups, come along – we want your help making a difference.
- If you're worried about not being gamer enough, come.
- If you think you're an imposter, come.
- This isn't a group of experts, just people.
- We are interested in social and gaming problems.
- This is a support group. No-one knows what they are doing.

## The Rules

A code of conduct applies. This is true both in person and online.

- We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior. Don't make exclusionary jokes. Don't even make them "ironically".
- Don't harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.
– Rape culture is a bad thing. Do not make rape or sexual comments to people, games or objects.
- Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — gamering is not a competition (except when it's a tournament).
- We'd rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.
- We think feminism is a good thing. Discussion of how to make gamer anonymous more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this "has gone too far" aren't.
- Trolling is also not welcome. We do not troll other people in or out of our community.
